We can see that SalePrice rises sharply in tandem with the area, with a few outliers in the far-end of the spectrum. This trend is much more clear if we consider only the values below the 95% threshold (<2466 SF).\n",
    "Notable associations are **OverallQual** and **Neighborhood**. This means that property quality is connected to the area above grade, and that neighborhoods have different average property sizes.\n",

As SweetViz detected this variable as categorical, the first version of this graph wasn't ideal. We forced the cast of OverallQual and OverallCond to numerical in SweetViz and the cell that produces the notebook above has been since updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a straight correlation between quality and price. Of course: better houses are sold with higher prices. Quality also numerically correlates with the area above grade and age of the building. Interesting categorical associations are **Neighborhood** and **Foundation**, denoting that the neighborhood overall quality and the foundation type influence the overall quality of a property.\n",

    "The Neighborhood variable is simply the name of the region of the property. It correlates strongly with the property age (YearBuilt, 0.88), sale price (SalePrice, 0.74), and the overall quality (OverallQual, 0.72). Newer properties are usually pricier (with a few historical outliers), and new properties are usually clustered together.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a wealth of insights to be gathered from the relationship between Neighborhood and other variables: is the quality of a house inherent to its neighborhood? Was there a recent price spike/drop on houses sold in that region?"

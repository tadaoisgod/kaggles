# My Kaggle Repository

Here's the house of all the codes for my Kaggle competition entries.

They are organized in folders named after competition IDs, and separated in `data`, `media`, and `src` subfolders.
Usually, there's an exploratory and a modeling Notebook in the `src` folder. Submission score will be inside each Notebook.
